Changes for release 0.01:

- initial development release


Changes for release 0.02 (from release 0.01):

- format changes to communications log display, hex bytes displayed on
  separate lines from byte count, number of columns in display increased to
  allow 24 bytes per line, extra space added every 8 bytes

- new menu option added to set WR3 baud rate, currently only 9600, 19200 and
  38400 are supported

- the current device type is displayed on the main window

- the About window (with program version) removed, the Help menu removed,
  program name and version added to top of main window

- main window made resizable

- a raw message command added for WR2 and WR3, code is 'm', values supplied
  must be hex or numeric values (based on hex-input setting) separated by one
  or more spaces, WR2 format will add the message-length byte automatically to
  the start of the message, WR3 format will add the passthrough bit
  automatically if setting enabled (but will not strip off passthrough bit if
  setting is disabled)

- commands received from socket are shown with a different colour on log (than
  the default green of normal text messages)


Changes for release 0.03 (from release 0.02):

- file "program.txt" updated with current information

- main window no longer resizable

- an input field has been added to the main window and is now the supported
  method of entering commands (instead of a socket connection, although the
  socket support is still available unchanged from previous release), see
  "program.txt" for details

- WR3 baud rates of 57600 and 115200 have been added

- the "Options" menu now has an item to clear the debug windows (communications
  log and serial activity), both windows have a similar item added to their
  popup menu to clear the individual window

- a new command "f" added (for WR2 and WR3) to read a message from file
  "cmm.00n" (where "n" is 1 to 9), format is "f nn" (e.g. "f 1" will send
  contents of file "cmm.001")


Changes for release 1.00 (from release 0.03):

- bug fixed that did not always clear serial activity window correctly

- socket support has been disabled (although the code has been left in place
  for possible future raw message support through a socket connection), the
  network status display has been removed from the main window

- the "Reset socket communications" option has been removed, it has been
  replaced with a "Reset serial communications" option that closes and reopens
  the current serial port

- a text input mode has been added for raw messages (i.e. command "M"), text is
  indicated by a double quote ("), all subsequent characters up to next double
  quote are converted to byte values based on ASCII text

- a WR3 date/time input mode has been added for raw messages, date/time is
  indicated by a number sign (#), the following 14 digits are input as a date
  and time in the format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS", if less than 14 digits are supplied
  then the missing digits are taken from the default string "20000101000000",
  date and time will be converted to a 4-byte WR3 elapsed seconds value

- invalid numeric input (i.e. ones that don't start with a valid digit) no
  longer terminate command, value is set to zero (applies to all commands that
  accept input)

- the byte count on the communications log for WR2 and WR3 messages changed to
  same "hex (dec)" format as other numeric values, LifeSafer and disk file log
  still have older decimal-only format

- page number added to WR3 dump command displayed on log

- all numeric input fields are now hex by default, any value may be entered as
  decimal by adding a '.' immediately before the first digit, the "Hex numeric
  input" item has been removed from the Options menu

- a raw hex display window has been added (called Serial Monitor window),
  format is similar to communications log window (i.e. fixed width, vertical
  resizing), shows hex values of all bytes transmitted or received, transmitted
  bytes are cyan, received bytes are white

- all text in the main window has been changed to the default GUI font

- LifeSafer now uses the same special command format as other devices (this is
  to allow non-text characters to be sent), only the raw message command ("M")
  and the send file command ("F") are supported


Changes for release 1.01 (from release 1.00):

- debug window painting redone to reduce flicker on resizing, italic fonts
  handled properly by serial activity window


Changes for release 1.02 (from release 1.01):

- a log upload function added for WR2 devices, requires firmware 3.32 or later,
  see "program.txt" for details

- timeout message added to communications log for LifeSafer devices, some other
  communications log messages enhanced

- the communications log window is always opened at program start (since no
  command status information is currently available on the main window)


Changes for release 1.03 (from release 1.02):

- the file selection menu option for log update now works under WinXP


Changes for release 1.04 (from release 1.03):

- "Upload log file" Command menu item changed to "Upload file", now used for
  both WR2 (uploading log) and WR3 (uploading memory), default file extension
  for selecting WR3 memory file is "wr3", "U" command also works for WR3

- wr2 and wr3 addresses no longer increment above 0xFFFF (they loop back to 0),
  out of range page (high) set to 0 instead of 0xFF, out of range address
  (high) set to 0 instead of 0xFFFF

- descriptive changes made to some debug messages

- page and address shown on main window, this is the page and address used for
  a WR3 memory file upload

- in the documentation (file "program.txt") the "R" command which was called
  a reset command is now called a redump command

- new "A" command has been added to set address without doing a memory dump,
  redump command "R" will set address to address used by last "D nnnn " or
  "A nnnn" (i.e. last "D" or "A" command that supplied an address)

- file upload selection dialog starts in default directory even if no matching
  file exists

- old socket communications code (which was not being used) removed

- high-level retry added for WR3 file upload, will retry if confirmation
  message indicates an error (assumes flash write or erase in progress)

- if error occurs opening log upload file a message (containing random bytes)
  will no longer be sent

- can no longer change serial port, device type, WR3 baud rate, or WR3
  passthrough if a command is being processed (i.e. if communications is
  taking place with current device), menu items are not disabled (will just not
  work)


Changes for release 1.05 (from release 1.04):

- bug fixed that prevented WR3 file upload from working in passthrough mode


Changes for release 1.06 (from release 1.05):

- upload file names and last-used directories are saved between program
  sessions, separate upload file names and directories are used for WR2 log
  file uploads and WR3 memory file uploads 

- the upload command generated from the menu upload function is added to the
  command list


Changes for release 1.07 (from release 1.06):

- some utility functions replaced with the functions recently added to the
  standard utility library (in UTIL.LIB 2.55)

- some utility functions replaced with calls to similar functions in the new
  device utility library (DUTIL.LIB)

- "Dump file" Command menu item added for WR3 to dump a block of memory to a
  file, default file name and location same as used by the upload file command,
  also available from command line using "W" command

- new command "B" added to set the number of bytes to dump to a file when using
  the "Dump file" command

- the documentation has been changed to refer to the existing "dump" command as
  "display" in order to avoid confusion with the new command that dumps data to
  a file

- the values for display block size, dump block size, memory page, and reset
  memory address are saved between sessions

- leading (and trailing) spaces are removed from command line before it is
  stored on history list

- commmand codes (first byte of command line) are all converted to lower case
  before command line is processed

- one-byte commands no longer stored on history list (existing one-byte
  commands that were added by a previous version will remain until they drop
  off the bottom of the list)

- if a command matches an existing command on the history list the previous
  entry is removed when the new one is added

- edit input area is filled in with last saved command (i.e. the top command on
  the command history list) at program start


Changes for release 1.08 (from release 1.07):

- the memory dump and display byte counts are now displayed on the main screen
  (for applicable devices)


Changes for release 1.09 (from release 1.08):

- clients information parameters added as another parameter type


Changes for release 1.11 (from release 1.10):

- passthrough bit removed before messages displayed in debug log window

- a batch mode feature has been added, any text supplied on the command line
  is processed as a command, program runs in background and terminates when
  command is completed, responses from device are written to file "batch.$$$"


Changes for release 1.11a (from release 1.11):

- bug fixed in batch message processing (all messages were truncated to one
  byte)

  of previous fixed length of 180 bytes), command is "L" (see "program.txt")


Changes for release 1.13 (from release 1.12):

- new command added to set or clear WR3 passthrough mode (to allow changing
  passthrough mode in batch mode), command is "T" (see "program.txt" for
  details), this command is not identical to the menu option (i.e. the menu
  option does not generate this command) but it has the same effect

- new commands added to dump WR3 event logs, uses command "E" to set event log
  type (primary or secondary) and command "G" to dump log, (see "program.txt"
  for details)

- command to dump log added to command menu, requires file name (i.e. does not
  support "G" command with no file name parameter)

- passthrough mode and event log type added to main window, WR3 upload/dump

- when log is dumped using batch command, file "batch.lst" will be created even
  if log has zero records

- if a reset message (0x3E) is sent to a WR3 device then the low-level retries
  are disabled

- new commands added to backup and restore WR3 EEPROM, uses command "K" to

- accelerator key for setting WR3 passthrough mode changed to Ctrl+T (was
  Ctrl+P)

- a second version of the program executable is now produced which always runs
  in batch mode ("cmm-b.exe"), original program ("cmm.exe") no longer has the
  batch mode feature

- batch mode program "cmm-b.exe" is compiled as a console application so that
  standard output is available, all records written to file "batch.$$$" are
  also written to standard output (which can be piped or redirected)


Changes for release 1.18 (from release 1.17):

- serial port no longer kept open, serial port is opened each time a command is
  initiated and closed when command is completed

- menu option to reset serial communications no longer applies and has been

  opened and closed)

- accelerator keys added for serial port selection (Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+9)

  location so not visible, asterisk is displayed when last attempt to open
  current serial port failed, cleared at start of program and when serial port
  changed


Changes for release 1.20 (from release 1.19):

- serial port not closed immediately after each command processed, will now
  stay open and close only after ten seconds of inactivity (or serial port
  changed)

- bug fixed that did not always repaint main window when one of the displayed
  values changed

- bug fixed that opened and closed serial port for commands that do not send
  any messages to device

  also result in menu state being incorrect (commands would stay disabled)


Changes for release 1.21 (from release 1.20):

- new "Custom" setting added for serial port selection, will display a dialog
  that lets any number from 1 to 999 to be selected as the comm port

- a command has been added ("Z nnn") to set the serial port from the command
  interface (so that it can be set in batch mode), note that just like all
  other commands the value is hexadecimal by default


Changes for release 1.22 (from release 1.21):

- support added for new WR3 Miscellaneous Parameters message (additional
  message type in WR3 Parameters window)


Changes for release 1.23 (from release 1.22): - 2007/03/29

  under Windows XP or later)

- bug fixed that did not reset menu state if errors occurred processing some
  commands

- a command has been added to do a WR3 firmware update from an S2 file,
  similar to "Upload from file" but sets page, address and length from the
  S2 records, command is "X filename", also added to Commands menu


Changes for release 1.25 (from release 1.24): - 2009/09/22

- maximum size in bytes for WR3 firmware update increased to 256K (was 64K),
  maximum S2 records in file increased to 8192 (was 5000) 

- communications thread startup fixed

- V7 device type and raw V7 device type added, V7 uses same serial port
  settings as WR3 but WR3-specifc commands are disabled (only basic command
  to send a message supported), raw V7 has different serial settings and reads
  and writes bytes without formatting (intended for V7 bootloader testing)

- appropriate message will be displayed in the communications log window
  whenever a serial port is opened or closed

- file "program.txt" updated


Changes for release 1.26 (from release 1.25): - 2009/11/11

- main screen display fixed to ensure all settings not applicable to current
  device type are shown as "N/A"

- V7 processing fixed to no longer do full WR3 processing (which would produce
  unexpected results if a response message code matched certain WR3 response
  message codes)

- support added for G-Series testing, new device type "G-Series" added, if set
  then serial port setting ignored and communications is with G-Series device
  connected to a USB port, only basic commands to send a message supported
  (i.e. read from file or enter raw message)

- Serial Monitor and Serial Activity renamed Port Monitor and Port Activity
  to indicate they are no longer serial-port only

- "program.txt" updated to reflect G-Series support and related changes
